# CloudComputing
## Introduction

This is an assignment repo created for the course "Cloud Computing and Services" of University of West Attica. In this repo you will find:
1. Files to create a VPN between a server (i.e. a remote computer) and a client (i.e. your computer).
2. Examples of Ansible playbooks, yml files and bash scripts that aim to automate deployment (and other functionality).
3. Docs with instruction on how to set up the VPN and explanation of the Ansible playbooks.

> **IMPORTANT:** The Ansible playbooks are based on hypotheticals, meaning that they theoritically, based on the Ansible handbook, should work but are untested. I did not manage to make the service (docker WordPress, more on docs) work nor had the time to test the playbooks before the deadline.
